# python-challenge
The purpose of this project was to go through a budget dataset and an election dataset. 

With the budget data, the task was to create a Python script that would analyze the records to calculate each of the following:
  
  1.)The total number of months included in the dataset
  2.)The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  3.)The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  4.)The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  5.)The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
  
 With the election data the task was to create a Python script that would analyze the votes and calculates each of the following:

  1.)The total number of votes cast
  2.)A complete list of candidates who received votes
  3.)The percentage of votes each candidate won
  4.)The total number of votes each candidate won
